## Recommendation Engine Prototype on Command Line Interface(CLI)
### By Michel Atieno, created on November 2023.

### Description
Proof of concept movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering.


### How to load CLI locally to test prototype recommendation system
    - Clone the project to local machine using the command "git clone https://github.com/MichelAtieno/Recommendation_System.git". This will allow you to access the project files.
    - Go into directory, on the root of the project where all the files are located. Activate the virtual environment using the command "source virtual/bin/activate". This will allow you to use the packages/libraries required for the project. Once you have activated the virtual enviroment, you will be able to run the project on the Command Line.
    ****If you are using another method to install the packages, they are available in the requirements.txt file. Use the command "pip install -r requirements.txt".

    You can run the project in two ways on the Command Line: 
    - Run the command "super", which will prompt you to input a name. There are examples of names highlighted on the prompt(from the sample data provided), which you can use to test the output. If you input a name which is not in the examples provided, a prompt will be provided with examples of movie names, where you can input a movie name and recommendations will be provided accordingly.
    - The second option is to run the command "python supercli.py", which will prompt you to input a name and next steps are similar to the process above.
